- **Overview:**  
  Developed a custom license plate anonymization system using a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) trained from scratch. This system automatically detects and anonymizes license plates in images, ensuring privacy while preserving the overall visual context.

- **Key Highlights:**  
  - Utilizes the power of diffusion models for progressive denoising.  
  - Maintains image quality while effectively obscuring sensitive information.

- **Visual Example:**
